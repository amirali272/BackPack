// The direct tunnel wizard.
//
// Nobody should have to write TOML. This asks the questions in the order the
// answers depend on each other, and writes the file itself.
//
// The order matters and is not the reverse wizard's. There, the transport is
// chosen first because every transport works. Here, the answers narrow each
// other: which machine you are on decides which questions are even asked, and
// what kind of tunnel you want decides which transports can carry it — a
// layer-3 tunnel cannot run over a reliable transport at all. Asking in
// dependency order means an impossible combination is never offered, rather
// than offered and then rejected.
//
//	1. which machine — Iran or kharej
//	2. what kind     — forwarded ports, or a full IP tunnel
//	3. how it travels — only the transports that can carry that kind
//	4. the details    — ports, addresses, whatever the choices above imply
//
// Geography is the user-facing name throughout. It is what stays true in both
// directions: Iran exposes the ports either way, and only who dials changes.
// "server" and "client" would be actively misleading here, because in a direct
// tunnel the Iran machine is the one that dials.

// directSide is which machine the wizard is being run on.
