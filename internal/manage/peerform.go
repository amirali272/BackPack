// MirrorForPeer works out what the other side of a tunnel has to be told; this
// is what turns that answer into the two structures that actually build a
// tunnel. In the panel the step is invisible, because PeerForm's field names
// and the setup form's field names are the same strings, and the browser fills
// one from the other by name.
//
// A managed node has no browser in the middle, so the same mapping has to exist
// here. It is written out field by field rather than done with reflection: the
// three places a name differs — the side, the address, the peer address — are
// exactly the places a silent mismatch would produce a tunnel that builds
// cleanly and never comes up.
