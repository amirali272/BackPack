// Two requests, because the measurement is not something to start by accident.
// The first asks what a measurement would involve — which mapping it would run
// through, and therefore which service on the far server goes quiet while it
// does. The page shows that and waits. The second runs it.
//
// Both are write-authenticated. Reading a tunnel's plan says which ports its
// backends are on, and the measurement itself pushes real traffic and takes a
// real service down for ten seconds; neither belongs to the read-only token.

// handleSpeedTestPlan answers what this machine can measure for one tunnel.
