// The panel.
//
// This is the whole web UI. It used to be the second of two: a rebuilt panel
// served under /panel/ beside the single-file dashboard in assets, with a
// per-server setting deciding which of them "/" opened. That arrangement was
// scaffolding for the rebuild — a way to ship an unfinished panel without
// taking the finished one away — and it is gone now that the rebuild is done.
// The dashboard, the setting, and the escape hatch back to it went with it.
//
// What is left is the ordinary case: this panel is served at "/", and the
// assets it asks for relatively resolve against the root. /panel/ still
// answers, with a redirect, because operators bookmarked it while the two
// panels lived side by side.
//
// Only what the browser actually loads is embedded. mock/ is the preview's
// fixture data and serve.py is its dev server; shipping either would put a
// second, fake source of truth inside the binary.
