/* What the server means by a tunnel's state.
 *
 * manage.Health reports "online", "offline" or "stopped", and the panel adds
 * "unknown" when it has not been told. The screens used to compare against
 * "running", which nothing on this codebase has ever produced: every screen
 * therefore treated a working tunnel as a dead one — the card said Stopped, the
 * overview counted it among the ones that are not running, and the speed test
 * and the link test refused to offer it at all.
 *
 * "offline" is its own answer and not a synonym for stopped: the service is up
 * and the configuration is live, but nothing is answering on the other side.
 * Saying "Stopped" there sends somebody to restart a service that is running.

 * calling it offline would send somebody to restart a service that is running
 * and working. What is wrong is one hop further on — the service it forwards
 * to, on the other machine, is refusing every connection. The server sends the
 * sentence; this is the one place that decides what to do with it. */
